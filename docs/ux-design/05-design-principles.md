# Design Principles & Implementation Guidelines

*Core design philosophy, technical framework integration, and implementation standards*

## üéØ User Experience Priorities

**1. Progressive Disclosure**
- Complex features revealed step-by-step
- Clear progress indicators throughout flows
- "Show more/less" options prevent overwhelming users

**2. Visual Hierarchy** 
- Important actions use Bulma's bright, colorful buttons
- Secondary actions in muted tones
- Clear information grouping with consistent spacing

**3. Error Prevention**
- Smart suggestions before allowing new entries
- Visual confirmations for destructive actions
- Auto-save functionality prevents data loss

**4. Mobile-First Responsive Design**
- Large touch targets (44px minimum)
- Swipe gestures for common actions
- Readable text sizes across all devices

## üé® Bulma CSS Integration Strategy

**Color Palette Application:**
- **Primary (Blue)**: Main action buttons, navigation
- **Success (Green)**: Completion states, positive feedback
- **Warning (Yellow)**: Coverage warnings, tips
- **Danger (Red)**: Delete actions, critical errors
- **Info (Cyan)**: Helper text, pro tips

**Component Usage:**
- **Cards**: Recipe displays, meal plan items
- **Forms**: Input fields with built-in validation styles
- **Buttons**: Consistent sizing and hover states
- **Badges/Tags**: Recipe categorization and filtering

## üõ†Ô∏è Functional Programming Alignment

**State Management:**
- Each interface represents a pure function of application state
- Clear data flow from user actions ‚Üí model updates ‚Üí view rendering
- Immutable data structures throughout (Lists, Sets, Records)

**Component Architecture:**
- Reusable view functions that compose cleanly
- Message-based communication between components
- Side effects handled through Elm's Cmd system

## Key Functional Programming Patterns for Elm Implementation

**Pure Function Architecture**
- All components use pure `update` functions with explicit state transitions
- Side effects handled through `Cmd` messages only
- Immutable data structures throughout (`List`, `Set`, `Dict`)

**Elm Architecture Compliance** 
- Model-Update-View pattern for all components
- Message-driven state changes
- Subscription-based external interactions (HTTP, timers, touch events)

**Composition Over Inheritance**
- Reusable view functions that compose together
- Shared utility functions for common operations (normalization, filtering)
- Component nesting through message forwarding

## Implementation Recommendations

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. **Recipe Entry Speed**: Implement auto-save every 30 seconds and smart defaults
2. **Drag & Drop**: Use HTML5 drag API with touch event fallbacks for mobile
3. **Global Tag System**: Case-insensitive search with fuzzy matching algorithms
4. **Mobile Performance**: Lazy loading for large recipe lists, efficient DOM updates

**Bulma CSS Integration:**
- Use Bulma's card components for recipe display
- Leverage Bulma's form controls with custom styling
- Implement responsive breakpoints for mobile-first design
- Utilize Bulma's color palette for visual distinction between recipes/one-off items

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Lazy loading** patterns for large collections
- **Skeleton states** for progressive loading
- **Offline-first** design for mobile shopping experience

## Design System Foundation

### Typography & Spacing
- **Base font size**: 16px (1rem) for optimal mobile readability
- **Line height**: 1.5 for comfortable reading
- **Spacing scale**: Bulma's built-in spacing utilities (0.25rem increments)
- **Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, body text, and metadata

### Interactive Elements
- **Buttons**: Minimum 44px touch targets with clear visual feedback
- **Form fields**: Generous padding, clear focus states, helpful validation
- **Cards**: Subtle shadows, hover states for interactive elements
- **Lists**: Adequate spacing, clear separation between items

### Accessibility Standards
- **Color contrast**: WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 for normal text)
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements
- **Screen readers**: Semantic HTML with appropriate ARIA labels
- **Focus management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order

### Mobile-First Approach
- **Touch targets**: 44px minimum for comfortable finger interaction
- **Swipe gestures**: Natural mobile interactions for common actions
- **Responsive breakpoints**: Mobile (320px+), Tablet (768px+), Desktop (1024px+)
- **Performance**: Optimized for slower connections and limited processing power

This design system ensures consistency, accessibility, and optimal user experience across all devices while maintaining the functional programming principles that make Elm applications robust and maintainable.
