5. Searchable and filterable tag combinations

**Insights Discovered:**
- Users need ultimate flexibility in categorization
- Combining multiple tag types provides more value than single classification method
- Visual elements could enhance but not replace text-based tags

### What If Scenarios - 20 minutes

**Description:** Explored monetization opportunities through hypothetical scenarios

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Multi-service delivery integration with commission model
2. Manufacturer sponsorship and coupon integration
3. Both detailed comparison and quick recommendation UX flows for delivery

5. Partnership revenue sharing models

**Insights Discovered:**
- Multiple delivery options increase user choice and revenue potential
- Manufacturer partnerships align with user value (savings) and revenue goals
- Cost tracking can be strategically tiered for monetization

**Notable Connections:**
- Delivery partnerships complement rather than compete with core value proposition

### Mind Mapping - 10 minutes

**Description:** Expanded future subscription features from core ideas

**Ideas Generated:**
1. YouTube video recipe importing capability
2. Mobile companion app as pure assistant (not creator)
3. Recipe import from images and URLs
4. Shopping checklist and meal completion tracking on mobile
5. AI-powered cost tracking database maintenance
